SECRET MESSAGE
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination.
The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. 
The word steganography is derived from the Greek words steganos (meaning hidden or covered) and the Greek root graph (meaning to write).
